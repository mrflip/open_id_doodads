h2. About these icons

The original OpenID logo got muddy at low resolutions, so I hacked up a tweaked
version that better keeps the spirit of the original at tiny sizes.

The tweaks:
* darken the arrow so it didn't get washed out
* align things with pixel boundaries so vertical and horizontal bondaries
  remain sharp
* make the shapes much larger (and clunkier) to retain visual weight.

The vector files of the tweaked versions are noticably clunkier than the
original.  If you use them at larger sizes people will point and laugh.

I actually can't find anything about the license for the original.  Hopefully
they're cool with it.

I studied the .svg icon from halfgeek.org while preparing mine.

h2. Which to use

The files are all transparent .pngs, named
  @@openid  -  PIXEL_SIZE  - BACKGROUND_MATTE .png@@

* pixel size is obvious: how big the icon.
* background matte is the background color the transparency mattes best on, to avoid annoying light-colored fringing around the icon.

There are also two variants from the excellent free-license icon collection at
